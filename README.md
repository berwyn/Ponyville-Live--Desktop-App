Ponyville Live! Desktop App
=========

The Ponyville Live! Desktop app was designed for [Ponyville Live!][1] by TheAuzzieBrony.

This fork is overhauled and maintained by [berwyn][3].

The chrome application is designed to make it simpler and easier for users to tune into their favourite radio station on the Ponyville Live! network without having to open a new browser window and so on. Just open the app and select your station.
